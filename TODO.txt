* Add tests
* Add ways to read graphs from file
** GraphML, GML, XGMML, 
* Add example of a puzzle
* Add documentation
* Algorithms: 
** branch&bound, fringe search, SMA*
** already available: depth-first, breadth-first, uniform-cost, greedy best-first, A*, depth-limited, iterative deepening depth-first, IDA*)
* What about splitting AbstractSearchProblem into problem and algorithm? Each search algorithm would have its separate class derived from AbstractSearchAlgorithm. I think this would make it easy to inspect the current state of the search, for example, to display it in a UI.
* Add generic implementation of State
