* Add tests
* Add ways to read graphs from file
* Add example of a puzzle
* Add documentation

* Algorithms: IDA* (like iterative-deepening but repeatedly increasing the maximum f-cost instead of the maximum depth), fringe search, SMA*, 
(already available: depth-first, breadth-first, uniform-cost, greedy best-first, A*, depth-limited, iterative deepening depth-first)
